}
```

  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `remove_account_on_destroy` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether to remove the invited account when delete the
  invitation (handshake). Defaults to false.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

## Import

The organizations account invite can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_organizations_account_invite.test <id>
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to some attributes missing from the
API response, security or some other reason. The missing attributes include: `remove_account_on_destroy`. It is
generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing an account invite. You can then decide if changes should
be applied to the account invite, or the resource definition should be updated to align with the account invite.
Also you can ignore changes as below.

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_organizations_account_invite" "test" {
  ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      remove_account_on_destroy,
    ]
  }
}
```
