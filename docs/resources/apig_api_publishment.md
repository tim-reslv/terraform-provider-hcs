# huaweicloud_apig_api_publishment

Using this resource to publish an API to the environment or manage a historical publish version within HuaweiCloud.

~> If you republish on the same environment or switch versions through other ways (such as console) after the API is
published through terraform, the current resource attributes will be affected, resulting in data inconsistency.

## Example Usage

### Publish a new version of the API

```hcl
variable "instance_id" {}
variable "env_id" {}
variable "api_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_apig_api_publishment" "default" {
  instance_id = var.instance_id
  env_id      = var.env_id
  api_id      = var.api_id
}
```

### Switch to a specified version of the API which is published

```hcl
variable "instance_id" {}
variable "env_id" {}
variable "api_id" {}
variable "version_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_apig_api_publishment" "default" {
  instance_id = var.instance_id
  env_id      = var.env_id
  api_id      = var.api_id
  version_id  = var.version_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region in which to publish APIs.
