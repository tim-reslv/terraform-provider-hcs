## Import

The organizations account invite accepter can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_organizations_account_invite_accepter.test <id>
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to some attributes missing from the
API response, security or some other reason. The missing attributes include: `leave_organization_on_destroy`. It is
generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing an account invite accepter. You can then decide if
changes should be applied to the account invite accepter, or the resource definition should be updated to align with
the account invite accepter. Also you can ignore changes as below.

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_organizations_account_invite_accepter" "test" {
  ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      leave_organization_on_destroy,
    ]
  }
}
```
