# huaweicloud_apig_throttling_policy

Manages an APIG (API) throttling policy resource within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

### Create a basic throttling policy

```hcl
variable "instance_id" {}
variable "policy_name" {}
variable "description" {}

resource "huaweicloud_apig_throttling_policy" "test" {
  instance_id       = var.instance_id
  name              = var.policy_name
  description       = var.description
  type              = "API-based"
  period            = 10
  period_unit       = "MINUTE"
  max_api_requests  = 70
  max_user_requests = 45
  max_app_requests  = 45
  max_ip_requests   = 45
}
```

### Create a throttling policy with a special throttle

```hcl
variable "instance_id" {}
variable "policy_name" {}
variable "application_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_apig_throttling_policy" "test" {
  instance_id      = var.instance_id
  name             = var.policy_name
  type             = "API-based"
  period           = 10
  period_unit      = "MINUTE"
  max_api_requests = 70

  app_throttles {
    max_api_requests     = 40
    throttling_object_id = var.application_id
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region where the throttling policy is located.  
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `instance_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of the dedicated instance to which the throttling
  policy belongs.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `name` - (Required, String) Specifies the name of the throttling policy.  
  The valid length is limited from `3` to `64`, only Chinese and English letters, digits and underscores (_) are
  allowed.  
  The name must start with a Chinese or English letter.

* `period` - (Required, Int) Specifies the period of time for limiting the number of API calls.
  This parameter applies with each of the API call limits: `max_api_requests`, `max_app_requests`, `max_ip_requests`
  and `max_user_requests`.

* `max_api_requests` - (Required, Int) Specifies the maximum number of times an API can be accessed within a specified
  period. The value of this parameter cannot exceed the default limit `200` TPS.

* `max_app_requests` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the maximum number of times the API can be accessed by an app within
  the same period.  
  The value of this parameter must be less than or equal to the value of `max_user_requests`.

* `max_ip_requests` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the maximum number of times the API can be accessed by an IP address
  within the same period.  
  The value of this parameter must be less than or equal to the value of `max_api_requests`.

* `max_user_requests` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the maximum number of times the API can be accessed by a user within
  the same period.  
  The value of this parameter must be less than or equal to the value of `max_api_requests`.

* `type` - (Optional, String) Specifies the type of the request throttling policy.  
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **API-based**: limiting the maximum number of times a single API bound to the policy can be called within the
    specified period.
  + **API-shared**: limiting the maximum number of times all APIs bound to the policy can be called within the specified
    period.

* `description` - (Optional, String) Specifies the description about the API throttling policy.
  The description contain a maximum of `255` characters and the angle brackets (< and >) are not allowed.

* `period_unit` - (Optional, String) Specifies the time unit for limiting the number of API calls.
  The valid values are **SECOND**, **MINUTE**, **HOUR** and **DAY**, defaults to **MINUTE**.

* `user_throttles` - (Optional, List) Specifies the array of one or more special throttling policies for IAM user limit.
  The [object](#throttles_rule) structure is documented below.

* `app_throttles` - (Optional, List) Specifies the array of one or more special throttling policies for APP limit.
  The [object](#throttles_rule) structure is documented below.

<a name="throttles_rule"></a>
The `user_throttles` and `user_throttles` blocks support:

* `max_api_requests` - (Required, Int) Specifies the maximum number of times an API can be accessed within a specified
  period.

* `throttling_object_id` - (Required, String) Specifies the object ID which the special throttling policy belongs.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the API throttling policy.

* `user_throttles` - The array of one or more special throttling policies for IAM user limit.
  The [object](#throttles_rule_attr) structure is documented below.

* `app_throttles` - The array of one or more special throttling policies for APP limit.
  The [object](#throttles_rule_attr) structure is documented below.

* `created_at` - The creation time of the throttling policy.

<a name="throttles_rule_attr"></a>
The `user_throttles` and `user_throttles` blocks support:

* `throttling_object_name` - The object name which the special user/application throttling policy belongs.

* `id` - ID of the special user/application throttling policy.

## Import

API Throttling Policies can be imported using their `name` and related dedicated instance ID, separated by a slash, e.g.

```shell
$ terraform import huaweicloud_apig_throttling_policy.test <instance_id>/<name>
```
