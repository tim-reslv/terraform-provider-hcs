variable "policy_id" {}
variable "api_publish_ids" {
  type = list(string)
}

resource "huaweicloud_apig_throttling_policy_associate" "test" {
  instance_id = var.instance_id
  policy_id   = var.policy_id
  publish_ids = var.api_publish_ids
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region where the dedicated instance and the throttling policy
  are located.  
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this will create a new resource.

  throttling policy belongs.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `publish_ids` - (Required, List) Specifies the publish IDs corresponding to the APIs bound by the throttling policy.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Resource ID. The format is `<instance_id>/<policy_id>`.

## Import

Associate resources can be imported using their `policy_id` and the APIG dedicated instance ID to which the policy
belongs, separated by a slash, e.g.

```shell
$ terraform import huaweicloud_apig_throttling_policy_associate.test <instance_id>/<policy_id>
```
